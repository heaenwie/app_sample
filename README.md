## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

## Test users

For creating seeds in the database, use Faker.

Run:

```
$ db:seed
```

Which will create given number of fake users in the db.

## Errors caching

Errors are catched in Rollbar.
